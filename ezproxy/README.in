DM_SECTION(EZproxy)

DM_BEGIN_COLLAPSIBLE

This is the code which cleans/processes/compiles the raw EZproxy
web logs and produces a single data set (concatenates all logs)
containing pertinent/derived fields.

DM_SUBSECTION(software dependencies)

DM_SMALL1(Reminder: this is only necessary if you want to DM_ITALIC(build)
this project. If you just want to consume the data product this outputs,
you can skip to the section named "How to read the data product")

Assumes a fairly recent version of R, and the following R packages
(as of 2021-05-08)

- DM_CODE(colorout)
- DM_CODE(data.table) (version 1.14.1 or above)
- DM_CODE(magrittr)
- DM_CODE(stringr)
- DM_CODE(openssl)
- DM_CODE(libbib) (any version 1.6.2 or above)

In addition to R, step 1 requires a compilation of a C++ program. Running
DM_CODE(make) in the root directory will produce the proper executable
(DM_CODE(step-1-clean-raw-logs-YEAR)) in the same directory, given that
you have a C++ toolchain (DM_CODE(build-essential), etc...),
DM_CODE(libfmt-dev), and DM_CODE(libre2-dev) installed.

DM_SMALL(Fun note: step 1 used to be in lisp but I wanted to see if I can
improve the perfomance any by switching to C++. My first attempt was
10x slower (the c++ standard regex library isn't so fast). After a lot of
trial and error, I finally got it down to 33% of the time it took the lisp
script to run. Having said that, I estimate I'd have to (busy-wait) run this
over a thousand times to make back my development time investment.)

Lastly, DM_CODE(OpenSSL) must be installed for the DM_CODE(openssl) R package
to dynamically link to.

Developed on Debian GNU/Linux 10, 11, 12


DM_SUBSECTION(build instructions)

The first step is to DM_CODE(rsync) the log directory from the EZproxy web
server to the local directory called DM_CODE(logs).
You can do this by running DM_CODE(./step-0-sync-logs.sh).
That file also contains comments/reminders that you have to (a)
be connected to the VPN, and (b) add DM_CODE(ezproxy) to your DM_CODE(/etc/hosts)
or (better) DM_CODE(~/.ssh/config).

If you're just beginning to use this now, many of the logs going back to the
will no longer be available.

Once the logs have finished (one way) syncing, run
DM_CODE(./step-1-clean-raw-logs-YEAR). This produces a single, cleaned,
intermediate data set containing the IP address, patron barcode,
session, datetime of access, a shortened URL, and the full URL.
This script (in addition to concatenating all daily logs into one file)
excludes certain log entries, cleans URLs, and converts the dates
into ISO 8601 format.
This tab-separated file is stored in DM_CODE(./intermediate/cleaned-logs.dat).

Finally, run the R script DM_CODE(./step-2-compile-ezproxy-stats-YEAR.R).
This is where most of the processing takes place. It, among other things:

- (irreversibly) hashes the patron barcode
- categorized barcode type
- joins with patron data to bring in ptype, home branch, and creation date
  (and DM_ITALIC(only) those fields)
- joins with a vendor crosswalk to resolve the URL to a particular
  broad vendor


DM_SUBSECTION(how to read the data product)

The final product is DM_CODE(./target/exproxy_2021-up-to-YYYY-MM-DD.dat.gz)
where DM_CODE(YYYY-MM-DD) is an ISO 8601 date.
This is a gzipped-tab-delimited data file.
You can un-gzip it (DM_CODE(gzip -d DATAFILE)) and then read it with
any software that reads tab-delimited files. Note that
LibreOffice. Gnumeric, or Excel aren't going to cut it for
this one; the data file can have up to over 80 million rows.
The full data set from 2020 contains 65.8 million rows.

In R, you can use DM_CODE(fread) from the DM_CODE(data.table) package to read
it straight from its gzipped form...

DM_CODE_BLOCK(
dat <- fread("./target/exproxy_2021-up-to-YYYY-MM-DD.dat.gz")
)


DM_SUBSECTION(fields)

The data product contains the following fields
- DM_CODE(session)
  a unique session identifier

- DM_CODE(ptype)
  patron type

- DM_CODE(date_and_time)
  and ISO 8601 date and time (to the second)

- DM_CODE(vendor)
  a broad vendor category

- DM_CODE(url)
  a shortened URL

- DM_CODE(barcode)
  an (irreversibly) hashed patron barcode

- DM_CODE(barcode_category)
  broad categorization of barcode type

- DM_CODE(homebranch)
  the patron's hone branch

- DM_CODE(fullurl)
  the full URL

- DM_CODE(patroncreatedate)
  The date that the patron was created

- DM_CODE(extract)
  An attempt to pull the specific database accessed from the full URL

- DM_CODE(just_date)
  Just the date of the access (no time component) (in ISO 8601, or course)
